Description:
In the database there are three imaginary tables, one for all citizen and their NID.
Second table citizen and their TIN.
Third table contains citizen NID , bank name ,account no, balance.
There is a search option on the search page.
If user enter any NId and press search then it returns wheather the NID holder have a TIN or not.
User can also find the Nid holders all bank accounts and balance.

This is just an example. I can intigrate real life data with this application.
Python can handle millions of data.
